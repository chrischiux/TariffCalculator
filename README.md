This tool currently has only been tested with CSV file of Octopus Energy. If you have access to another energy company's usage export file, feel free to provide it in a new Issue. :)

Built using TypeScript, React, and Bootstrap.

## Functionality
1. Price Check

   Check if the total cost including standing charge will be lower with a new tariff
3. Capacity check

   Check if the off-peak period is sufficiently long enough for your current usage

## How to obtain CSV file

1. Go to Octopus Energy dashboard

   [octopus.energy/dashboard](octopus.energy/dashboard)
2. Go to the "My Energy" tab (or "energy" tab for mobile)
3. Scroll to "Get your energy geek on"
4. Select a date range (I recommend 1 whole month to reflect typical usage pattern)
5. click "Download"
